IDEA 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q Networks)
EARLY DELIVERABLES:

	- Using OpenAI Gym, implement reinforcement agent using Q-Learning (PoC for gym)
	- Using OpenAI Gym, implement reinforcement agent using DQN on the same environment as above
		# Experiment here with parameters
	 		~ Optimiser
			~ Batch size
			...
	- Extend with Double Deep Q network
	- Extend with Duelling Deep Q network

	- Access to CIM GPUs

	- Jupyter Notebook or not


IDEA 2: Music Genre Classification
EARLY DELIVERABLES:

	- Is MNIST allowed for early deliverables? Extended to audio_mnist
	- Can the PoC program be relatively shallow compared to final deliverable?
	- Experiments:
		# training epochs
		# ADAM vs RMSProp
		# learning rates
		# loss functions (dependent on problem to solve)
		# batch_size
		# Regularisation
		
	- Is Jupyter Notebook a reasonable platform to deliver code? 

	- GTZAN audio dataset - 10 genres, 100 observations in each (total 1000)

	- Access to CIM GPUs

	- Deep Belief Network vs CNN vs Transfer Learning methods
