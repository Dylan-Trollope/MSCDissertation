EARLY DELIVERABLES:

	- Is MNIST allowed for early deliverables? Extended to audio_mnist
	- Can the PoC program be relatively shallow compared to final deliverable?
	- Experiments:
		# training epochs
		# ADAM vs RMSProp
		# learning rates
		# loss functions (dependent on problem to solve)
		# batch_size
		# Regularisation
		
	- Is Jupyter Notebook a reasonable platform to deliver code? 

	- GTZAN audio dataset - 10 genres, 100 observations in each (total 1000)

	- Access to CIM GPUs

	- Deep Belief Network vs CNN vs Transfer Learning methods
