Experiments that I've already done
Have to do last few experiments
Write conclusion and do professional issues

three interesting points:
- value of max qs
- max value computed
- follow action with maximal q and see return (optimal policy)

- plot angle of pole vs where the doomed states might be 

- 0 because it starts at training
- peak 
- plot the differences
- why are the lines on top of each other
- why are doomed not 0

- avoiding areas of the state space
- over the course of training, diff between predicted and actual get smaller?
- what is return with no exploration
