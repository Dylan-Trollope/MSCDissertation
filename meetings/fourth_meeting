taking average over 10 runs of every episode
	-- smoother curve 
	-- but we know that any e_t is dependent on every e before it 
			-- stupid experiment? 

4D space vs Q value - theres a value, for every action, so just take the highest? 


Using convolutional net for CartPole is not very good, but still gives experiments and comparisons


slices through the value function

Fix one dimension and plot the 3D remaining 

concentration of beahviour 


number of epxriments

robustness test for random states

-- random starting states

freeze the network and see how good the states are 

compare the estimated value of the network vs actual q value 
-- give more reward for pole in the middle 

paragraph = idea (notes about what is in it)

dont put vital points in middle of paragraph

short statements about the idea -> logical ordering -> fluff into readable
